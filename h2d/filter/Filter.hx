/**
	The base filter class, you can extend it in order to define your own filters, although ShaderFilter will be the most straightforward way to define simple custom filter.

	Keep in mind that filters use internal Object resolution to render its content, hence scaling of the filtered object would not increase the rendering resolution.
	For example, 20x20px `Bitmap` with `scale = 2` will render onto 20x20 filter texture if filter is attached to it directly,
	but if filter is attached to the parent of that bitmap, filter will render 40x40 texture.  
	Another thing to be aware of, is that `Scene.scaleMode` does not affect filter resolution either,
	and upscaling contents with `scaleMode` would not upscale the resolution of filtered content.

	Filters limit their render area dictated by bound object boundaries, `Filter.autoBounds` and `Filter.boundsExtend` variables and `Filter.getBounds` method.
	See their respective docs for details.

	For optimization purposes, rendering boundaries are clipped by scene viewport and nothing will be rendered offscreen.
