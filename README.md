**Heaps** is a cross platform graphics engine designed for high performance games. It's designed to leverage modern GPUs that are commonly available on desktop, mobile and consoles.

Heaps is currently working on:
- HTML5 (requires WebGL)
- Mobile (iOS, tvOS and Android)
- Desktop with OpenGL (Win/Linux/OSX) or DirectX (Windows only)
- Consoles (Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4, XBox One - requires being a registered developer)
- Flash Stage3D

Samples
-------

In order to compile the samples, go to the `samples` directory and run `haxe gen.hxml`, this will generate a `build` directory containing project files for all samples.

To compile:
- For JS/WebGL: run `haxe [sample]_js.hxml`, then open `index.html` to run
- For HashLink: run `haxe [sample]_hl.hxml` then run `hl <sample>.hl` to run (will use SDL, replace `-lib hlsdl` by `-lib hldx` in hxml to use DirectX)
- For Flash: run `haxe [sample]_swf.hxml`, then open `<sample>.swf` to run
- For Consoles, contact us: nicolas@haxe.org

Project files for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are also generated.
