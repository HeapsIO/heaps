Samples
-------

In order to compile the samples, go to the `samples` directory and run `haxe gen.hxml`, this will generate a `build` directory containing project files for all samples.

To compile:
- For JS/WebGL: run `haxe [sample]_js.hxml`, then open `index.html` to run
- For Flash: run `haxe [sample]_swf.hxml`, then open `<sample>.swf` to run
- For HashLink: run `haxe -lib hlsdl|hldx [sample]_hl.hxml` then run `hl <sample>.hl` to run (can use both SDL and DirectX libraries)
- For OpenFL/Lime: run `openfl test windows` into the sample directory -- OpenFL/Lime is not officially supported, we don't accept issues please send pull requests if you make some changes

Project files for [HaxeDevelop](http://haxedevelop.org) are also generated
